# OotModLoader

This is a system for loading mods in Ocarina of Time 1.0.

## Features
- Load romhacks without manually applying patches
- Load plugins that interact with the game RAM during runtime.
- Networked by default: Everything is made with multiplayer in mind.

### OotOnline
OotOnline comes bundled with the ModLoader as the first plugin created for it. This plugin gives you the ability to share your Ocarina of Time experience with friends. See your friends in the game world, share items and quest progress with them, and push them off ledges as you progress through this timeless classic together.

##### Installation instructions
